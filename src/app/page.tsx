              Paragraph example 1: about Bali Bali is predominantly a Hindu
              country. Bali is known for its elaborate, traditional dancing. The
              dancing is inspired by its Hindi beliefs. Most of the dancing
              portrays tales of good versus evil. To watch the dancing is a
              breathtaking experience. Lombok has some impressive points of
              interest – the majestic Gunung Rinjani is an active volcano. It is
              the second highest peak in Indonesia. Art is a Balinese passion.
              Batik paintings and carved statues make popular souvenirs. Artists
              can be seen whittling and painting on the streets, particularly in
              Ubud. It is easy to appreciate each island as an attractive
              tourist destination. Majestic scenery; rich culture; white sands
              and warm, azure waters draw visitors like magnets every year.
              Snorkelling and diving around the nearby Gili Islands is
              magnificent. Marine fish, starfish, turtles and coral reef are
              present in abundance. Bali and Lombok are part of the Indonesian
              archipelago. Bali has some spectacular temples. The most
              significant is the Mother Temple, Besakih. The inhabitants of
              Lombok are mostly Muslim with a Hindu minority. Lombok remains the
              most understated of the two islands. Lombok has several temples
              worthy of a visit, though they are less prolific. Bali and Lombok
              are neighbouring islands. Paragraph about Bali: possible solution
